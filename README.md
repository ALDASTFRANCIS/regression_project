# Linear & Logistic Regression Project (From Scratch + Scikit-learn)

This project demonstrates **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression** using two approaches:

1. **From Scratch** using NumPy
2. **Using Scikit-learn** for real-world implementation

Both regression types are implemented to give a clear understanding of the underlying math, as well as how to use libraries effectively.
